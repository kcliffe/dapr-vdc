Arch:
 - Define levels of adoption
 - Create Level 1 (full adoption) proto
   - Includes:
     - Internal non-Transient (or longer term transient) retry using Timers
     - Clients as services?
 
Investigate:
 - Workflow.SetCustomStatus

Test:
 - ðŸ˜€ Happy path
 - ðŸ˜€ Transient
 - Non Transient

 Apssettings for debug level

Thoughts: 
- Level 1
    - Workflow takes list of id, state. Can start a workflow from any status. So can be used to replay all metric states if required.
    - Proxy APi in front of Workflow to handle accepting metric "queries" and hydrating records for workflow
- Services - how micro servicey do we want to be?
